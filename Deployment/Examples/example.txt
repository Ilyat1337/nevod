IS ANDROID OR IPHONE THE BETTER SMARTPHONE?

When it comes to buying one of the best smartphones,
the first choice can be the hardest: iPhone or Android.

Hardware is the first place where the differences
between the iPhone and Android become clear.

Only Apple makes iPhones, so it has extremely tight
control over how the software and hardware work
together. On the other hand, Google offers the Android
software to makers, including Samsung, HTC, LG, and
Motorola. Because of that, Android phones vary
widely in size, weight, features, and quality.

Premium-priced Android phones tend to be as good as
the iPhone in terms of hardware quality, but cheaper
Android options are more prone to problems. Of course
iPhones can have hardware issues, too, but they're
generally higher quality.

If you're buying an iPhone, you just need to pick
a model. Because many companies make Android devices,
you have to pick both a brand and a model, which can
be a bit confusing.

Some may prefer the greater choice Android offers,
but others appreciate Apple's simplicity and quality.
